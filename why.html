            <h2>Why I Chose This Project</h2>
            <p>
                My interest in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) goes beyond academic curiosity. 
                This project is closely tied to my long-term goal of becoming a corporate lawyer. I have a passion for corporate finance and the stock market, 
                and I want to understand how business decisions, particularly M&As, impact companies, shareholders, and the economy at large.
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who follows stocks, I often see how M&A deals affect stock prices and shareholder value, 
                but I wanted a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind these transactions. 
                This project gave me the opportunity to explore the complexities of M&As and gain insights into their strategic importance.
            </p>
            <h3>The Flaws and Challenges in M&As</h3>
            <p>
                I was also drawn to this project because I wanted to investigate the flaws in the M&A process and understand the human factors that play a role. 
                Through my research, I learned that M&As are not just financial maneuvers but are deeply affected by leadership styles, company culture, and sometimes, the personal motives of CEOs. 
                For example, I discovered cases where CEOs prioritize personal gains over the company’s best interest, “trading power for premium” in ways that don’t always align with shareholder value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding these flaws and challenges is essential for anyone pursuing corporate law, as corporate lawyers often help guide companies through these transactions. 
                Knowing the pitfalls and how to navigate them will be invaluable as I work to represent companies and ensure that both legal and ethical standards are maintained in such high-stakes decisions.
            </p>
            <h3>Preparing for My Future Career</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, this project has helped deepen my understanding of the legal, financial, and human aspects of M&As. 
                By analyzing real-world examples and exploring various types of mergers (horizontal, vertical, conglomerate), 
                I’ve gained insights that will be directly relevant as I move toward my career in corporate law. 
                This knowledge not only prepares me for future challenges but also fuels my passion for helping companies make sound, responsible business decisions.
